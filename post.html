                        Akaza did not deserve to die because, beneath his monstrous exterior, he was a deeply tragic 
              figure shaped by pain, loss, and a desperate longing for strength born out of love and 
              helplessness. Before becoming a demon, Akaza was Hakuji—a young man who endured unbearable 
              suffering, losing his sick father and later his beloved fiancée, Koyuki, along with the life 
              he had built. His transformation into a demon was not born from malice but from grief and 
              despair, a result of circumstances that robbed him of everything he cared for.
